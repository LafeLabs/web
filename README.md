Welcome to Web 1.0. Just simple static web pages.  No users. No logins, no passwords, no encryption, no private data. This is a cardboard sign on the side of the road.  It is a chalk board in a hallway.  Spray paint on a dumpster.  Just simple messages of whatever we want to share with other people, spread out in the physical world.  To edit this document, use [editscroll.html](editscroll.html).

See the code and copy the syntax.  The format of this document is called "[markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)" and it is designed to be the simplest possible way to format a document using plain text.   

Put images on a site like [imgur.com](https://imgur.com/) and drop them into image links using ![]() syntax.

 - point browser to [your domain]/replicator.php
 - point browser to [your domain]/editscroll.html to edit the scroll
 - set up [PI CRUST](https://github.com/LafeLabs/picrust) servers, post hyperlinks to the ip addresses of them on various local networks with instructions to where the wifi is for that server
 - make physical media which points to the domain
